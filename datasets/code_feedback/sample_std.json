To simplify the process of initiating a Django web framework on Amazon Web Services using the Boto3 toolkit, we can create a Python script that will handle the configuration of the operating environment, deployment of the web application, and modification of server settings.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of the steps the script will perform:\n\n1. Configure AWS credentials and create the necessary AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS database, S3 bucket).\n2. Set up the operating environment by installing required packages and dependencies.\n3. Clone the Django project repository from a version control system (e.g., Git).\n4. Configure the Django project settings (e.g., database connection, static files storage location).\n5. Create and apply the database migrations.\n6. Collect static files.\n7. Set up the web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) and configure it to serve the Django application.\n8. Start the web server and enable it to automatically start on system boot.\n9. Optionally, set up a domain name and configure DNS settings.\n\nThroughout the script, we will handle potential exceptions or errors gracefully by using appropriate error handling techniques.\n\nPlease provide more specific details about your Django project, such as the AWS services you want to use and any other specific requirements.",

To solve the problem, we must remove the 'key=max' from the max function call.

        "description": "To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach. We can iterate through all possible combinations of people and check if each combination forms a sufficient team. We will keep track of the smallest team size and the team with the highest total skill level.\n\nHere is the algorithm:\n1. Initialize a list `result` to store the indices of the people in the smallest sufficient team.\n2. Initialize two variables `smallest_size` and `max_skill` to keep track of the smallest team size and the highest total skill level, respectively.\n3. Generate all possible combinations of people using the itertools.combinations() function. Iterate through each combination.\n4. For each combination, initialize a set `team_skills` to keep track of the skills covered by the combination.\n5. Iterate through each person in the combination. For each person, iterate through their skills and add them to the `team_skills` set.\n6. Check if the `team_skills` set covers all the required skills. If it does, calculate the team size and total skill level.\n7. If the team size is smaller than `smallest_size`, update `smallest_size` and `max_skill`. Also, update the `result` list with the indices of the people in the combination.\n8. If the team size is equal to `smallest_size`, compare the total skill level with `max_skill`. If it is higher, update `max_skill` and `result`.\n9. After iterating through all combinations, return the `result` list.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n"
