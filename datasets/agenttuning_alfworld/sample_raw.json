For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. You should choose from two actions: \"THOUGHT\" or \"ACTION\". If you choose \"THOUGHT\", you should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"THOUGHT: your thoughts.\n ACTION: your next action\n\"; If you choose \"ACTION\", you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"ACTION: your next action\n\". After your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n Reminder: \n1. the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. \n2. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process."
