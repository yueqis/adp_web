Such markets, as modeled, operate without the intervention of government or any other external authority. Proponents of the free market as a normative ideal contrast it with a regulated market, in which a government intervenes in supply and demand by means of various methods such as taxes or regulations. In an idealized free market economy, prices for goods and services are set solely by the bids and offers of the participants.\nScholars contrast the concept of a free market with the concept of a coordinated market in fields of study such as political economy, new institutional economics, economic sociology and political science. All of these fields emphasize the importance in currently existing market systems of rule-making institutions external to the simple forces of supply and demand which create space for those forces to operate to control productive output and distribution. Although free markets are commonly associated with capitalism in contemporary usage and popular culture, free markets have also been components in some forms of market socialism.Historically, free market has also been used synonymously with other economic policies. For instance proponents of laissez-faire capitalism may refer to it as free market capitalism because they claim it achieves the most economic freedom. In practice, governments usually intervene to reduce externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions; although they may use markets to do so, such as carbon emission trading.\n\nPage: Black market in wartime France\nSummary: After the defeat of France in 1940, a black market developed in both German-occupied territory and the zone libre controlled by the Vichy regime.

Some historians of economics believe that he coined the phrase laissez faire, laissez passer. Evidence was to be found when the French State parted the West Indies Company privilege (monopoly) on the slave trade. He is also credited with coining the term  \"bureaucracy\". Together with  François Quesnay, whose disciple he was, he was a leader of the Physiocratic School.\nGournay's father was Claude Vincent, a merchant in Saint-Malo as well as a secretary to the king.  Gournay didn't write much, but had a great influence on French economic thought through his conversations with many important theorists.  He became instrumental in popularizing the work of Richard Cantillon in France.Gournay was appointed an intendant du commerce in 1751.  One of the main themes of his term in office was his opposition to government regulations because of what he saw as the way they stunted commerce.  He coined the term bureaucratie (literally \"government by desks\") to describe the situation.  Gournay's disdain for government regulation of commerce influenced his disciple  Turgot.Gournay's first name is often mistakenly given as \"Jean\", due to an error made by Turgot in his letter to Jean-François Marmontel known as In Praise of Gournay.A street in Saint-Malo, the Rue Vincent-de-Gournay, takes its name from him.\n\n\n\nPage: Jean-Claude Trichet\nSummary: Jean-Claude Trichet (French: [ʒɑ̃ klod tʁiʃɛ]; born 20 December 1942) is a French economist who served as President of the European Central Bank from 2003 to 2011. Previous to his assumption of the presidency he served as Governor of the Bank of France from 1993 to 2003.\nAfter stepping down from the European Central Bank, Trichet ...\n[Output Truncated]\nYou have 2 steps left and 1 chances to propose solution left.",
