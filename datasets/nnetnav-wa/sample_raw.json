These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164].

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Issues · Dashboard ·

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'Postmill', focused,

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'All forums', focused,

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164].

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

By clicking this link, I will be taken to the project page where I can update the README.md file and create a merge request. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [2424]```\n<|eot_id|>",

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164].

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164].

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164].

It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective.

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): New merge request · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab\n\n[7583] RootWebArea 'New merge request · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[7635] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[7800] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[7944] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[8975] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[8708] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[7951] link 'Create new...'\n\t[7953] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[8252] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[7954] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[8254] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[7956] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[8270] generic 'Todos count'\n\t[7957] link 'Help'\n\t[7959] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[8304] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[7636] complementary 'Project navigation'\n\t\t[7835] listitem 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[7961] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[7962] link 'Project information'\n\t\t[7964] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[7966] link 'Issues'\n\t\t\t[8410] StaticText '0'\n\t\t[7968] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[7970] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[7972] link 'Security & Compliance'\n\t\t[7974] link 'Deployments'\n\t\t[7976] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[7978] link 'Infrastructure'\n\t\t[7980] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[7982] link 'Analytics'\n\t\t[7984] link 'Wiki'\n\t\t[7986] link 'Snippets'\n\t\t[7988] link 'Settings'\n\t\t[7773] button 'Collapse sidebar'\n\t[7640] navigation 'Breadcrumbs'\n\t\t[8005] link 'Software Architecture Group'\n\t\t[8007] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[8009] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[8011] link 'New'\n\t[7589] main ''\n\t\t[7643] heading 'New merge request'\n\t\t[7878] StaticText 'From '\n\t\t[7880] StaticText 'byteblaze-main-patch-37576'\n\t\t[7881] StaticText'into '\n\t\t[7882] code ''\n\t\t[7883] StaticText'\\xa0 '\n\t\t[7884] link 'Change branches'\n\t\t[7886] StaticText 'Title (required)'\n\t\t[7593] textbox 'Title (required)' focused: True required: True\n\t\t\t[8014] StaticText 'Added clear documentation of the process and minor updates to the README.md file.'\n\t\t[7899] link 'Start the title with Draft:'\n\t\t[7900] StaticText \" to prevent a merge request draft from merging before it's ready.\"\n\t\t[7901] StaticText 'Add '\n\t\t[7902] link 'description templates '\n\t\t[7903] StaticText 'to help your contributors to communicate effectively!'\n\t\t[7908] StaticText 'Description'\n\t\t[8668] button 'Write'\n\t\t[8669] button 'Preview'\n\t\t[8783] button 'Add bold text (Ctrl+B)'\n\t\t[8784] button 'Add italic text (Ctrl+I)'\n\t\t[8785] button 'Add strikethrough text (Ctrl+⇧X)'\n\t\t[8786] button 'Insert a quote'\n\t\t[8787] button 'Insert code'\n\t\t[8788] button 'Add a link (Ctrl+K)'\n\t\t[8789] button 'Add a bullet list'\n\t\t[8790] button 'Add a numbered list'\n\t\t[8791] button 'Add a checklist'\n\t\t[8794] button 'Add a collapsible section'\n\t\t[8795] button 'Add a table'\n\t\t[8796] button 'Attach a file or image'\n\t\t[8797] button 'Go full screen'\n\t\t[8029] textbox 'Description' required: False\n\t\t[8037] StaticText 'Supports '\n\t\t[8038] link 'Markdown'\n\t\t[8039] StaticText '.

By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): New merge request · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab\n\n[7583] RootWebArea 'New merge request · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[7635] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[7800] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[7944] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[8975] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[8708] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[7951] link 'Create new...'\n\t[7953] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[8252] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[7954] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[8254] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[7956] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[8270] generic 'Todos count'\n\t[7957] link 'Help'\n\t[7959] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[8304] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[7636] complementary 'Project navigation'\n\t\t[7835] listitem 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[7961] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[7962] link 'Project information'\n\t\t[7964] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[7966] link 'Issues'\n\t\t\t[8410] StaticText '0'\n\t\t[7968] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[7970] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[7972] link 'Security & Compliance'\n\t\t[7974] link 'Deployments'\n\t\t[7976] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[7978] link 'Infrastructure'\n\t\t[7980] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[7982] link 'Analytics'\n\t\t[7984] link 'Wiki'\n\t\t[7986] link 'Snippets'\n\t\t[7988] link 'Settings'\n\t\t[7773] button 'Collapse sidebar'\n\t[7640] navigation 'Breadcrumbs'\n\t\t[8005] link 'Software Architecture Group'\n\t\t[8007] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[8009] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[8011] link 'New'\n\t[7589] main ''\n\t\t[7643] heading 'New merge request'\n\t\t[7878] StaticText 'From '\n\t\t[7880] StaticText 'byteblaze-main-patch-37576'\n\t\t[7881] StaticText'into '\n\t\t[7882] code ''\n\t\t[7883] StaticText'\\xa0 '\n\t\t[7884] link 'Change branches'\n\t\t[7886] StaticText 'Title (required)'\n\t\t[7593] textbox 'Title (required)' required: True\n\t\t\t[8014] StaticText 'Added clear documentation of the process and minor updates to the README.md file.'\n\t\t[7899] link 'Start the title with Draft:'\n\t\t[7900] StaticText \" to prevent a merge request draft from merging before it's ready.\"\n\t\t[7901] StaticText 'Add '\n\t\t[7902] link 'description templates '\n\t\t[7903] StaticText 'to help your contributors to communicate effectively!'\n\t\t[7908] StaticText 'Description'\n\t\t[8668] button 'Write'\n\t\t[8669] button 'Preview'\n\t\t[8783] button 'Add bold text (Ctrl+B)'\n\t\t[8784] button 'Add italic text (Ctrl+I)'\n\t\t[8785] button 'Add strikethrough text (Ctrl+⇧X)'\n\t\t[8786] button 'Insert a quote'\n\t\t[8787] button 'Insert code'\n\t\t[8788] button 'Add a link (Ctrl+K)'\n\t\t[8789] button 'Add a bullet list'\n\t\t[8790] button 'Add a numbered list'\n\t\t[8791] button 'Add a checklist'\n\t\t[8794] button 'Add a collapsible section'\n\t\t[8795] button 'Add a table'\n\t\t[8796] button 'Attach a file or image'\n\t\t[8797] button 'Go full screen'\n\t\t[8029] textbox 'Description' required: False\n\t\t\t[9075] StaticText 'This merge request adds clear documentation of the process to the README.md file to make it easier for new contributors to join the project.'\n\t\t[8037] StaticText 'Supports '\n\t\t[8038] link 'Markdown'\n\t\t[8039] StaticText '.

By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164].

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164].

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): One Stop Market\n\n[1]

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step.

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Face - Skin Care - Beauty & Personal Care\n\n[2738] RootWebArea 'Face -

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'Dashboard / Magento Admin', focused, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/dashboard/'\n\t[148] link 'Magento Admin Panel', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/'\n\t\t[149] image 'Magento Admin Panel', visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/static/version1681922233/adminhtml/Magento/backend/en_US/images/magento-icon.svg'\n\t[150] navigation '', visible\n\t\t[151] menubar '', visible, orientation='horizontal'\n\t\t\t[153] link '\\ue604 DASHBOARD', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/dashboard/'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue604'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'DASHBOARD'\n\t\t\t[156] link '\\ue60b SALES', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/dashboard/#'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue60b'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'SALES'\n\t\t\t[189] link '\\ue608 CATALOG', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/dashboard/#'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue608'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'CATALOG'\n\t\t\t[207] link '\\ue603 CUSTOMERS', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/dashboard/#'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue603'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'CUSTOMERS'\n\t\t\t[226] link '\\ue609 MARKETING', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/dashboard/#'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue609'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'MARKETING'\n\t\t\t[293] link '\\ue602 CONTENT', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/dashboard/#'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue602'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'CONTENT'\n\t\t\t[339] link '\\ue60a REPORTS', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/dashboard/#'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue60a'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'REPORTS'\n\t\t\t[464] link '\\ue60d STORES', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/dashboard/#'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue60d'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'STORES'\n\t\t\t[540] link '\\ue610 SYSTEM', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/dashboard/#'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue610'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'SYSTEM'\n\t\t\t[623] link '\\ue612 FIND PARTNERS & EXTENSIONS', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/marketplace/index/'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue612'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'FIND PARTNERS & EXTENSIONS'\n\t[645] button 'System Messages: 1', clickable, visible\n\t\tStaticText 'System Messages'\n\t\tStaticText ':'\n\t\tStaticText '1'\n\tStaticText '\\ue623'\n\tStaticText 'Failed to synchronize data to the Magento Business Intelligence service.'\n\t[651] link 'Retry Synchronization', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/analytics/subscription/retry/'\n\t[661] banner '', visible\n\t\t[664] heading 'Dashboard', visible\n\t\t[667] link '\\ue600 admin', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/system_account/index/'\n\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue600'\n\t\t\tStaticText 'admin'\n\t\t[679] link '\\ue607', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/admin/notification/index/'\n\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue607'\n\t\t[683] LabelText '', clickable, visible\n\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue60c'\n\t\t[687] textbox '\\ue60c', clickable, visible\n\t[693] main ''\n\t\tStaticText 'Scope:'\n\t\t[704] button 'All Store Views', clickable, visible, hasPopup='menu'\n\t\t[715] link '\\ue633 What is this?', clickable, visible, url='https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/scope.html'\n\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue633'\n\t\t\tStaticText 'What is this?'\n\t\t[722] button 'Reload Data', clickable, visible\n\t\t[728] sectionheader '', visible\n\t\t\tStaticText 'Advanced Reporting'\n\t\tStaticText \"Gain new insights and take command of your business' performance, using our dynamic product, order, and customer reports tailored to your customer data.\"\n\t\t[731] link 'Go to Advanced Reporting \\ue644', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-128-17-139.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/admin/analytics/reports/show/'\n\t\t\tStaticText 'Go to Advanced Reporting'\n\t\t\tStaticText '\\ue644'\n\t\tStaticText 'Chart is disabled.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'Dashboard / Magento Admin',

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'Orders / Operations / Sales /
