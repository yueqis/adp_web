Given the initial values of $A$ and $B$ (in binary representation), he needs you to help him compute the number of times the while-loop of the algorithm is repeated.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains a single string $A$.\n- The second line contains a single string $B$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of iterations the algorithm will perform during addition of the given numbers $A$ and $B$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le |A|, |B| \\le 10^5$\n- $A$ and $B$ contain only characters '0' and '1'\n- the sum of $|A| + |B|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (20 points): $|A|, |B| \\le 30$\nSubtask #2 (30 points):\n- $|A|, |B| \\le 500$\n- the sum of $|A| + |B|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n100010\n0\n0\n100010\n11100\n1010\n\n-----Example Output-----\n0\n1\n3\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: The initial value of $B$ is $0$, so while-loop is not performed at all.\nExample case 2: The initial values of $A$ and $B$ are $0_2 = 0$ and $100010_2 = 34$ respectively. When the while-loop is performed for the first time, we have:\n- $U = 34$\n- $V = 0$\n- $A$ changes to $34$\n- $B$ changes to $2 \\cdot 0 = 0$\nThe while-loop terminates immediately afterwards, so it is executed only once.\nExample case 3: The initial values of $A$ and $B$ are $11100_2 = 28$ and $1010_2 = 10$ respectively. After the first iteration, their values change to $22$ and $16$ respectively. After the second iteration, they change to $6$ and $32$, and finally, after the third iteration, to $38$ and $0$.\n\nYou should write code that expect inputs from stdin and print outputs (to stdout).\n\nYou have 5 chances to interact with the environment or propose a solution.
